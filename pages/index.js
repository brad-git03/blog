        <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Brad</strong>, I enjoy building scalable and user-friendly applications and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.</p>
        <p>
          I have a passion for all things tech and music. In my free time, I love to unwind by playing online games and delving into the world of coding. I also enjoy expressing my creativity through music, playing instruments like the guitar and piano.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite music genres are lofi music, which I find incredibly relaxing, and OPM songs, which I love for their meaningful lyrics and unique melodies. When it comes to food, I'm a big fan of pizza, ramen, and sushi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five years from now, I see myself as a successful developer. I'll have built a fulfilling career, constantly learning new technologies, and contributing to meaningful projects. I am dedicated to making that vision a reality and becoming a skilled and successful developer.
